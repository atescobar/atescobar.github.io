## Agustin's Personal Site

Hi! I'm Agustín Escobar and you've reached my website.

## Personal Projects

1. [ODE and PDE Numerical Methods Implentation in Python](https://github.com/atescobar/NumericMethods/tree/master/NumericalMethods)


## Research Experience

1. Master Thesis, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (Santiago, Chile, 2018 to date)
Titled “Mathematical Model of Concentration and Electric Field In Electrolyte Disolution Under REDOX reaction”, this project seeks to obtain a theoretical model to explain the relation of the concentration of copper-sulfate in electro-refineries of copper and connect it to nano-diamond based sensor measurements (NV-Center).

2. Undergraduate Thesis, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (Santiago,  Chile, January 2017 to July 2017 )
Titled “Transport Coefficients through a quantum dot in the Anderson Impurity Model”. We computed the electric and thermal conductivity and the Seebeck or thermoelectric coefficient through a magnetic impurity in a conductor.
Summer Internship, Efficiency Of A Quantum Thermodynamic Engine, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (Santiago de Chile, January 2016)

3. Theoretical project in which we computed the efficiency of thermodynamic engine based on an electron constrained to a graphene flake, controlled by an external magnetic field.

4. Cosmic Ray Telescope, HEPLAB UC (Santiago, Chile, 2014–2016)
Project at the High Energy Physics Laboratory where we built a Cosmic Ray Telescope based on plastic scintillators. The data was captured by an Arduino Uno board.

## Poster Presentation

1. School of Nanotechnology, Universidad Técnica Fereríco Santa María (Valparaíso, January 2019)
Presented thesis developments in the School of Nanotechnology organized by the UTFSM university in Valparaíso.


## Hobbies
